## Overview

This project leverages the power of React and WebRTC to create a real-time communication (RTC) application. WebRTC is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). Paired with the popular React library, this project aims to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience for real-time communication needs.
